	Old Sprint Review:
		PO Decappi demonstrated the latest backend version
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview

	Old Sprint Release:
		the latest version was released live by PO Decappi

	Old Sprint Retroperspective:
		Miro board did not worked so we used GoogleDrive:
			https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RSJhCRnhADVPKeWqalQdaIrGbmhU31N7oWfZQW3OImo/edit#gid=0
		Take aways:
			- Reply promptly (if necessary, let them know that you don't have time), Write down the protocol immediately
			- Maybe we should keep everything as simple as possible. Yes differnt frameworks or programs make life easier but it is only make things easier for the people who know how to use it 
			- build and share more knowledge about the APIs
			- Early communication / self tests
			- Task redistribution and more support for specific tasks
			- Define the particular interfaces in the tickets
		See Miro Board for a more detailed overview

	Organizational matters:
		Backend-member abdelelbehiri will leave the project

	New Sprint Planning:
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview
		two backend related user stories were not estimated

	Feedback from Coach:
		Don't move tickets back on the board
		the POs responded well to feedback
		the team is following the processes very well
		Zoom-Meetings should start some minutes before schedule
		We should keep a better time-slot management during our meetings
