	Old Sprint Review:
		One issue was not ready for review and has to be discussed in the group.
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview.

	Old Sprint Release:
		The latest version was released live by Decappi.

	Old Sprint Retroperspective:
		Some of our Takeaways concern our goals for the new year 2022.
		Takeaways:
			- The interfaces from Backend towards NLP has to be implemented with failure-safety, so that we can run our code even when NLP is not ready yet
			- Work on tickets earlier (not just a day before or even the same day)
			- Assign tickets to people
			- Goal: the NLP model covers all user queries we defined in the team
			- Successfully complete the project, learn something new

	Feedback from Coach:
		Make sure to start work early on tickets.
		No further negative points mentioned.

	Organizational matters:
		numanfidan was not present. His absence was communicated to the group in advance.

	New Sprint Planning:
		One ticket was estimated to size = 13, so we decided to split it into at least two smaller tickets.
		We have already assigned two tickets for Backend to chrisjherm and numanfidan (new process from a Takeaway).
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview.
