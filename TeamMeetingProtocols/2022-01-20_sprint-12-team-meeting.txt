	Old Sprint Review:
		Issue #178 "Implement route length algorithm" had a bug but we made a bugticket instead of rejection.
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview.

	Old Sprint Release:
		The latest version was released live by PO oliviadargel.

	Old Sprint Retroperspective:
		Takeaways:
			- We should consider a deadline, also we should improve our PR-Review-Process
			- Start earlier with tickets
			- Start earlier with communication
		We agreed to set our sprint deadline to Wednesday 8pm. At least a PR without merge conflicts should have been created until this point.

	Feedback from Coach:
		Make sure to start work early on tickets.
		Make sure to enhance communications.
		He praised the discussion at the retrospective.

	Organizational matters:
		Decappi was not present. His absence was communicated to the group in advance.

	New Sprint Planning:
		We forgot to assign tickets.
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview.
