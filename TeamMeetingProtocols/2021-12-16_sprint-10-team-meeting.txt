	Old Sprint Review:
		One Stakeholder was present this time.
		We had still one issue in the Progress-Column: #151 "External APIs Feature research"
		Three issues were left in the Awaiting-Review-Column: #150 "Find charging stations on routes",
		#156 "Parse unit alternatives" and #166 "Adjust dataset for new labels"
		Those four issues are still relevant for the upcoming sprint.
		See Kanban Board for a more detailed overview.
		After the Review the stakeholder left the meeting.

	Old Sprint Release:
		The latest version was released live by PO Decappi.

	Old Sprint Retroperspective:
		Todays Retro was about the first half of the entire project.
		Takeaways next sprint: 
			- Regular backend mid-sprint meetings (fixed schedule)
		Takeaways second half:
			- Prioritize issues in team which other teams depend on
			- Spread the understanding of the project vision among devs
			- discuss further steps with the whole team to make sure we reach our goal (tasks for the next 2-3 sprints, if someone has capacity, tasks can be done earlier)
			- Try to discuss any frontend questions in #frontend team discord chat. Keep up the good work!
			- keep it going!
