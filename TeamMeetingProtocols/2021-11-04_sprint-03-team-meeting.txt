	Old Sprint Review:
		We moved all issues from Awaiting review into the Archives swimlanes

	Old Sprint Release:
		It was released with no new review after release

	Old Sprint Retroperspective:
		We used the miro board
		Takeaways:
			- Backend: Research interfaces which can be used to get required data: Cureve length/percentage, elevation, pitch, ...
			- backend should meet extra in the upcoming sprint, at least one in the next two days
			- Smaller tasks, direct assignment to 1-2 persons
			- If problems, talk to the team or POs
			- assign homework task to the sub groups in the team meeting

	Organizational matters:
		abdelelbehiri will evaluate if he will continue in the project and address the POs about it

	Feedback from Coach:
		Prioritize issues for the planning and make them first
		rest of the feedback will come later

	New Sprint Planning:
		We agreed to fasten this process as much as possible
		If we have a disagreement, in the end, the highest number wins
